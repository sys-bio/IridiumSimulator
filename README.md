### Coming soon for summer 2022 - Beta has Arrived
 
 
Interactive desktop simulator (Windows/Mac) for systems biology. Built on top of the simulation engine [libroadrunner](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner).

Supports: Time course simulation, steady-state, real-time interactive simulation, parameter scans, slider control, MCA style sensitivity analysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_control_analysis), and network structural analysis. It uses the [antimony](https://github.com/sys-bio/antimony) format to describe models and is fully [SBML](https://github.com/sbmlteam/libsbml) compliant.

**Update** (Jul 6th): I now have a Mac OS version including the M1 version working (thanks to Lucian Smith for generating the M1 roadrunner binaries for me). I hope to release the source code and binaries for windows and Mac during the week of July 11th.

Source code and binaries for WIndows 64 have been uploaded. I have a working Mac version as a bundle but I'm not sure if that is the propoery way to distriubte Mac apps so I am figuring out how to create a dmg file.

I would like to thank Guillermo Canedo Ramirez who did an excellent job in making the real-time scrolling chart.

Here are some screenshots to show you what it looks like:
